3\. Our general employment terms include all our relevant rules, regulations, policies, codes, procedures, and notices, which are available in our Field Guide: LINK.

4\. You must read all of these and follow them where relevant.

What we expect of you  
  
5\. You promise, and we expect you to:

8\. You undertake to spend all your time during working hours (and sometimes after hours where necessary) on your job with us.
