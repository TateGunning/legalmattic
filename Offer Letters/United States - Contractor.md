###### <Legalese>

Effective February 15th, 2024, **Wendy Winkie** (“**Consultant**”) and Company agree as follows:

Services and Payment  
  
Consultant agrees to undertake and complete the Services (as defined in Exhibit A) in accordance with and on the schedule specified in **Exhibit A**. As the only consideration due Consultant regarding the subject matter of this consulting agreement (“Agreement”), Company will pay Consultant in accordance with **Exhibit A**.

You will have the opportunity to buy a special class of stock, called A12 shares, that only Automatticians can buy. They give Automatticians a chance to own a bit of Automattic, at a good price, which is typically less than what investors paid, and provide a stable buyer (Automattic). You are eligible to purchase up to USD 1,000,000 worth of A12 stock, per year. Details and additional terms of the A12 Plan can be found at: LINK, which are subject to change in the Company's sole discretion.

Ownership Rights; Proprietary Information; Publicity  
  
Company shall own all right, title, and interest (including patent rights, copyrights, trade secret rights, mask work rights, trademark rights, and all other intellectual and industrial property rights of any sort throughout the world) relating to any and all inventions (whether or not patentable), works of authorship, mask works, designations, designs, know-how, ideas, and information made or conceived or reduced to practice, in whole or in part, by Consultant during the term of this Agreement that relate to the subject matter of, or arise out of, the Services or any Proprietary Information (as defined below) (collectively, “**Inventions**”), and Consultant will promptly disclose and provide all Inventions to Company.

Consultant hereby makes all assignments necessary to accomplish the foregoing ownership. Consultant shall further assist Company, at Company’s expense, to further evidence, record, and perfect such assignments, and to perfect, obtain, maintain, enforce, and defend any rights assigned. Consultant hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Company as its agents and attorneys-in-fact, coupled with an interest, to act for and on Consultant’s behalf to execute and file any document and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the foregoing with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Consultant.

Consultant agrees that all Inventions and all other business, technical, and financial information (including, without limitation, the identity of and information relating to customers or employees) Consultant develops, learns, or obtains in connection with Services or that are received by or for Company in confidence, constitute “Proprietary Information.” Consultant will hold in confidence and not disclose or, except in performing the Services, use any Proprietary Information. However, Consultant shall not be obligated under this paragraph, with respect to information Consultant can document, is or becomes readily publicly available without restriction through no fault of Consultant. Upon termination and as otherwise requested by Company, Consultant will promptly return to Company all items and copies containing or embodying Proprietary Information, except that Consultant may keep its personal copies of compensation records and this Agreement. Consultant also recognizes and agrees that Consultant has no expectation of privacy with respect to Company’s telecommunications, networking, or information processing systems (including, without limitation, stored computer files, email messages, and voice messages) and that Consultant’s activity, and any files or messages, on or using any of those systems may be monitored at any time without notice.

As additional protection for Proprietary Information, Consultant agrees that during the period that it is to be providing Services, Consultant will not (i) encourage or solicit any employee or consultant of Company to leave Company for any reason, (ii) engage in any activity that is in any way competitive with the business or demonstrably anticipated business of Company, or (iii) assist any other person or organization in competing or in preparing to compete with any business or demonstrably anticipated business of Company. Without limiting the foregoing, Consultant may perform services for other persons only if such services do not represent a conflict of interest or a breach of Consultant’s obligation under this Agreement or otherwise.

To the extent allowed by law, any license to Company hereunder includes all rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal, and any other rights that may be known as or referred to as “moral rights,” “artist’s rights,” “droit moral,” or the like. Furthermore, Consultant agrees that notwithstanding any rights of publicity, privacy, or otherwise (whether or not statutory) anywhere in the world and without any further compensation, Company may and is hereby authorized to use Consultant’s name in connection with promotion of its business, products, and services and to allow others to do so. To the extent any of the foregoing is ineffective under applicable law, Consultant hereby provides any and all ratifications and consents necessary to accomplish the purposes of the foregoing to the extent possible. Consultant will confirm any such ratifications and consents from time to time as requested by Company. If any other person provides any Services, Consultant will obtain the foregoing ratifications, consents, and authorizations from such person for Company’s exclusive benefit.

If any part of the Services or Inventions is based on, incorporates, or is an improvement or derivative of, or cannot be reasonably and fully made, used, reproduced, distributed, and otherwise exploited without using or violating technology or intellectual property rights owned or licensed by Consultant and not assigned hereunder, Consultant hereby grants Company and its successors a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable right and license to exploit and exercise all such technology and intellectual property rights in support of Company’s exercise or exploitation of the Services, Inventions, other work performed hereunder, or any assigned rights (including any modifications, improvements and derivatives of any of them).

Warranty  
  
Consultant warrants that: (i) the Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner and that none of such Services nor any part of this Agreement is or will be inconsistent with any obligation Consultant may have to others; (ii) all work under this Agreement shall be Consultant’s original work and none of the Services or Inventions or any development, use, production, distribution, or exploitation thereof will infringe, misappropriate, or violate any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity (including, without limitation, Consultant); and (iii) Consultant has the full right to allow it to provide Company with the assignments and rights provided for herein.

Term; Termination  
  
This Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue until the completion of Services to Company’s satisfaction, unless earlier terminated as set forth below. If either party materially breaches a material provision of this Agreement, the other party may terminate this Agreement upon 10 days’ notice unless the breach is cured within the notice period. Company may also terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, upon 10 days’ notice. All Sections of this Agreement and any remedies for breach of this Agreement, excluding the Section entitled “Services and Payments,” shall survive any termination or expiration. Company may communicate such obligations to any other (or potential) client or employer of Consultant.

Independent Contractor; No Employee Benefits  
  
Consultant is an independent contractor (not an employee or other agent) solely responsible for the manner and hours in which Services are performed, and is solely responsible for all taxes, withholdings, and other statutory, regulatory, or contractual obligations of any sort (including, but not limited to, those relating to workers’ compensation, disability insurance, Social Security, unemployment compensation coverage, the Fair Labor Standards Act, income taxes, etc.), and is not entitled to participate in any employee benefit plans, fringe benefit programs, group insurance arrangements, or similar programs. Consultant agrees to indemnify Company from any and all claims, damages, liability, settlement, attorneys’ fees, and expenses, as incurred, on account of the foregoing or any breach of this Agreement or any other action or inaction of Consultant. If Consultant is a corporation, it will ensure that its employees, officers, and agents are bound in writing to Consultant’s obligations under this Agreement.

Assignment  
  
This Agreement and the Services contemplated hereunder are personal to Consultant and Consultant shall not have the right or ability to assign, transfer, or subcontract any obligations under this Agreement without the written consent of Company. Any attempt to do so shall be void. Company may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement in whole or part.

Notice  
  
All notices under this Agreement shall be in writing, and shall be deemed given when emailed, personally delivered, or three days after being sent by prepaid certified or registered U.S. mail to the address of the party to be noticed as set forth herein or such other address as such party last provided to the other by written notice. Any email notice to Company must be sent to hr@automattic.com.

Miscellaneous  
  
Any breach of the Sections entitled Ownership Rights; Proprietary Information; Publicity or Warranty will cause irreparable harm to Company for which damages would not be an adequate remedy, and therefore, Company will be entitled to injunctive relief with respect thereto in addition to any other remedies. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights. No changes or modifications or waivers to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees. Headings herein are for convenience of reference only and shall in no way affect interpretation of the Agreement.
