1\. Location of Employment

**1.2** You may be expected to travel throughout and outside of Australia from time to time in the performance of your duties, without any additional pay.

2\. Hours of Work

**2.1** You are employed on a full-time basis and may be required to work reasonable hours as necessary to perform your duties. Subject to applicable law, your pay includes compensation for additional hours worked, and you will not be entitled to any additional pay for working these hours.

You may also be required to work over the weekend or on a bank or public holiday, as provided by the guidelines on Working on Weekends and Holidays (LINK), and you agree that you will make yourself available to work these hours. Your remuneration package has been enhanced to incorporate compensation for hours worked on weekends and/or public holidays.

3\. Pay and Superannuation

**3.1** You will receive an annual gross salary of AUD 100,000 (less applicable tax) (the “Base Salary”). The Base Salary will be paid under Ausomattic’s payroll policy and is subject to periodic review.

**3.2** In addition to the Base Salary, the Company will make superannuation contributions on your behalf to a complying superannuation fund of your choice in accordance with the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth). In the absence of you nominating a complying fund, a fund will be chosen for you. The value of these contributions will be the minimum amount required to avoid a superannuation guarantee charge as set out in the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth). This contribution is inclusive of all statutory caps imposed on superannuation contributions.

**3.3** You will have the opportunity to buy a special class of stock, called A12 shares, that only Automatticians can buy.

You are eligible to purchase up to USD 1,000,000 worth of A12 stock, per year. Details and additional terms of the A12 Plan can be found at: LINK, which are subject to change in the Company's sole discretion.

In particular, you must comply with Ausomattic's rules regarding booking of holiday and logging of holiday days taken.

**4.2** You will accrue ten days personal (sick or carer's leave) per year of service. Personal/carer's leave may be used when you are unwell or if you need to take time off to care for a member of your immediate family or household.
