Employment Agreement
--------------------

**This agreement** is made on the 15th day of February of 2024.

**Between:**

(1) **Aut O’Mattic A8C Ireland Limited**, a company registered in Ireland, whose registered office is at **25 Herbert Place, Dublin 2, Dublin, D02AY86, Ireland** (“Automattic”); and

(2) **Paddy Pintpuller** of **St. James's Gate, Dublin 8, D08 VF8H, Ireland** (“Employee” or “You”).

**It is hereby agreed** as follows:

1\. Appointment  
  
Automattic will employ You as a **Guinness Testing Coordinator** reporting to **Paige Planner**, on the terms set out in this contract (“Agreement”).

2\. Commencement of Employment  
  
2.1 Your first day of work will be **February 15th, 2024** (“Commencement Date”) and your employment will continue, subject to the terms of this Agreement, until terminated by either party serving prior written notice on the other, as follows:

(a) if You have less than two (2) complete years of service: two weeks’ notice; and

(b) after two to five years of service: two weeks’ notice; after five to ten years of service: four weeks’ notice; after ten to fifteen years of service: six weeks’ notice; and more than fifteen years of service: eight weeks’ notice.

2.2 Your period of continuous employment will start on the Commencement Date.

3\. Duties  
  
3.1 As a **Guinness Testing Coordinator** You are required to discharge such duties as Automattic may deem consistent with that title as well as such additional duties as may be assigned to you from time to time by Automattic or our Board of Directors. Automattic expects that you will devote the whole of your time, attention, skill, and ability to your duties with Automattic and that you will not engage in any other employment or outside business activity. Automattic reserves the right to assign different work duties to you (either in addition to or instead of those duties referred to in Clause above), but Automattic won’t assign you work duties that You cannot reasonably perform.

3.2 You will obey the reasonable and lawful orders of Automattic, given by or with the authority of our Board. You are also required to comply with any and all rules, regulations, policies and/or procedures that we may, at our absolute discretion, introduce or have in operation from time to time. Failure to comply with said rules, regulations, policies and/or procedures may result in us having to take disciplinary action against you. This disciplinary action may involve the termination of your employment.

3.3 You may be required, in pursuing your duties, to perform services for Automattic and any Associated Company without further remuneration (except as otherwise agreed). You may also be required to accept any such position in any Associated Company which is consistent with Your position with Automattic, as Automattic may from time to time reasonably require. Automattic may at its sole discretion assign Your employment to any Associated Company on the same terms and conditions as set out herein.

3.4 You are employed on a full-time basis and will set your normal working hours, which we expect will be approximately 40 hours per week. You may be required to work such additional hours either as and when required to do so by Automattic or when necessary for the proper performance of your duties of employment. That fact has been taken into account in determining the amount of your annual salary and, for that reason, you shall not be entitled to any additional overtime payments in respect of the said additional hours or any Sunday working.

You may also be required to work over the weekend or on a bank or public holiday, as provided by the guidelines on Working on Weekends and Holidays (LINK), and you agree that you will make yourself available to work these hours. You will not receive any additional remuneration for any weekend or holiday work.

3.5 You authorize Automattic, and any agent instructed by Automattic, to access any program or data held on any computer used by You in the course of performing Your duties of employment.

4\. Exclusivity of Service; Conflicts of Interest  
  
4.1 You agree to devote your full time, attention, and abilities to your job duties during working hours and to act in the best interests of Automattic and its Associated Companies at all times.

4.2 You will not (without the prior written consent of Automattic) during your employment, directly or indirectly be interested in, engage in, be concerned with, or provide services to, any other person, company, business entity, or other organization whatsoever (whether as an employee, officer, director, agent, partner, consultant or otherwise).

4.3 During your employment, You agree to abide by the terms of the Automattic Conflict of Interest Policy, as it may be amended from time to time. LINK (copy enclosed)

5\. Remuneration  
  
5.1 You shall be paid a gross annual salary of EUR **100,000** per annum which shall be paid monthly in arrears \[directly into your bank account\] on the 28th of every month. Your annual salary may be reviewed on an annual basis although we shall be under no obligation, legal or otherwise, to either conduct the said review or to increase the said salary.

5.2 You will have the opportunity to buy a special class of stock, called A12 shares, that only Automatticians can buy. They give Automatticians a chance to own a bit of Automattic, at a good price, which is typically less than what investors paid, and provide a stable buyer (Automattic). You are eligible to purchase up to USD 1,000,000 worth of A12 stock, per year. Details and additional terms of the A12 Plan can be found at: LINK, which are subject to change in the Company's sole discretion.

6\. Expenses  
  
Automattic will reimburse You (against receipts or other satisfactory evidence) for all reasonable business expenses properly incurred in the course of Your employment, subject to Automattic's rules and policies relating to expenses in place from time to time.

7\. Deductions  
  
Automattic will be entitled at any time during Your employment, and in any event on termination, howsoever arising, to deduct from Your remuneration hereunder any monies due from You to Automattic. This includes, but is not limited to, any outstanding loans, advances, the cost of repairing any damage or loss to Automattic's property caused by You (and of recovering the same), and any other monies owed by You to Automattic. By signing this Agreement you hereby consent to the deduction of the said sums.

8\. Place of Work  
  
8.1 Your normal place of work will be Your home (or any other place as you may choose) or such other premises as Automattic may reasonably relocate you to from time to time.

8.2 In the performance of duties hereunder, You may be required to travel both throughout and outside the Republic of Ireland.

8.3 You will be responsible for maintaining a safe and productive work environment. Automattic will provide You with computer equipment, as may be required to perform your work duties, and will pay certain costs of maintaining a home office, as described here: LINK (copy enclosed)

9\. Sickness Benefit  
  
9.1 If You are sick or otherwise incapacitated, You must comply with Automattic's rules, from time to time in force, regarding sickness notification and doctor's certificates, details of which can be obtained from the HR team. In particular, in all cases of absence You must notify Automattic by email (hr@automattic.com) or by posting to your team’s P2 on the first morning of Your absence, giving the reason for the absence and its anticipated duration. You shall be expected to provide an appropriate medical certificate in any case where you are absent for three or more consecutive days. Thereafter medical certificates should be submitted regularly to cover the full period of absence. Any such medical certificate must specify the nature of your illness and the expected date of your return to work. Failure on your part to comply with any aspect of this clause may result in our having to take disciplinary action against you. That disciplinary action may involve the termination of your employment.

9.2 Automattic reserves the right to require You to undergo a medical examination by a doctor or consultant nominated by Automattic and at Automattic's cost, and to consent to such doctor or consultant to release such details of Your condition as Automattic reasonably considers relevant to Your employment.

9.3 If you comply with Clauses 10.1 and 10.2, You will be entitled to receive Company sick pay, in accordance with Automattic’s leave policy (here: LINK), as it may be in force from time to time. (copy enclosed)

9.4 If You are absent from work on grounds of sickness or other medical incapacity:

(a) You will continue to be covered by Automattic's applicable insurance schemes, if any; and

(b) Your entitlement to the payment of Automattic's pension contributions, and any other incentive or bonus scheme, and accrual of holiday above the statutory minimum will cease on the expiry of the relevant period of Automattic sick pay referred to in Clause 9.3 above.

9.5 If the illness, accident, or other incapacity is or appears to be caused by actionable negligence of a third party whereby damages are or may be recoverable, You will immediately notify Automattic of any claim, compromise, settlement or judgement made or awarded in connection with it. You will also give to Automattic all particulars that it may reasonably require and will, if required by Automattic, refund all or such part of the sums paid to or for the benefit of You by way of salary, bonus, or benefits during the relevant period as Automattic may reasonably determine. Any such amount to be refunded, however, will not exceed the amount of damages or compensation (and interest thereon) recovered by You, less any unrecovered costs borne by You in connection with the recovery of such damages or compensation, and will not exceed the total remuneration paid to You by way of salary, bonus, and benefits in respect of the period of such illness, accident, or other incapacity.

10\. Holidays  
  
You shall ordinarily be entitled to four weeks (20 days) paid annual leave per annum and nine (9) public holidays. Your annual leave entitlement shall be reduced on a pro rata basis during the years in which you commence and leave your employment. Our annual leave year runs from January 1 to December 31 each year. You shall not be permitted to carry annual leave from year to year and must, for that reason, take your entire annual leave allocation in the leave year to which it relates.

11\. Pension and Other Benefits  
  
11.1 You may be eligible to participate in Automattic’s pension plan (“Scheme”) subject to the terms and conditions of the Scheme from time to time in force. Details of the Scheme can be obtained from Lori McLeese, HR Lead. Automattic reserves the right to terminate or substitute another pension scheme for the Scheme. There is no contracting-out certificate in force in relation to the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme.

11.2 You will be eligible to participate in the Automattic health insurance plan and group life assurance and income protection plans, subject to the terms and conditions of such scheme(s) from time to time in force.

11.3 Any actual or prospective loss of entitlement to long-term disability or private medical insurance benefits will not limit or prevent Automattic from exercising its right to terminate Your employment in accordance with Clauses 2 or 14 hereof or otherwise and Automattic will not be liable to provide, or compensate for the loss of, such benefit(s).

12\. Confidentiality  
  
12.1 You will neither during Your employment (except in the proper performance of Your duties) nor at any time (without limit) after the termination thereof, howsoever arising, directly or indirectly:

(a) use for personal purposes or those of any other person, company, business entity, or other organization whatsoever; or

(b) disclose to any person, company, business entity, or other organization whatsoever;

any trade secrets or confidential information relating or belonging to Automattic or its Associated Companies including but not limited to any such information relating to customers, prospective customers, customer lists or requirements, price lists or pricing structures, marketing and information, business plans or dealings, employees or officers, source codes, computer systems, software, financial information and plans, designs, formulae, product lines, prototypes, research activities, services, any document marked “Confidential”, or any information which You has been told is “Confidential” (or with a similar expression) or which You might reasonably expect Automattic would regard as “Confidential”, or which is treated as “Confidential” by legislation, or any information which has been given to Automattic or any Associated Company in confidence by customers, suppliers, or other persons.

12.2 You will not at any time during employment with Automattic make any notes or memoranda relating to any matter within the scope of Automattic's business, dealings, or affairs otherwise than for the benefit of Automattic or any Associated Company.

12.3 You will immediately inform Automattic if You become aware, whether during Your employment or after its termination, of the possession, use or knowledge of any Confidential Information by any person not authorised to possess, use, or have knowledge of it. You agree to provide necessary assistance at Automattic’s request as is required to deal with such an event. This undertaking includes an obligation by You to report Your own conduct, whether or not any such conduct may also be regarded as a breach of any fiduciary or other duty.

12.4 The obligations contained in Clause 12.1 will not apply to any disclosures required by law, and will cease to apply to any information or knowledge which may subsequently come into the public domain after the termination of employment other than by way of unauthorised disclosure.

13\. Intellectual Property, Inventions, and Patents  
  
13.1 You acknowledge and agree that by virtue of the nature of Your duties and responsibilities arising from Your employment, You have, and will have at all times during Your employment, a special obligation to further the interests of Automattic.

13.2 You will provide Automattic with full written details of all:

(a) inventions, ideas, and improvements, whether or not patentable, and whether or not recorded in any medium ("Inventions"); and

(b) patents, rights to Inventions, copyright and related rights, trade marks, trade names and domain names, rights in get-up, rights in goodwill or to sue for passing off, rights in designs, rights in computer software, database rights, rights in confidential information (including know how and trade secrets) and any other intellectual property rights, in each case where registered or unregistered and including all applications (or rights to apply) for, and renewals or extension of rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection which may now or in the future subsist anywhere in the world (“Intellectual Property Rights”), created or acquired by You, wholly or partially, in the course of Your employment (whether or not during working hours or using Company premises or resources and whether or not recorded in any medium) (“Employment IPRs”), promptly upon creation.

13.3 To the fullest extent permitted by law:

(a) all Employment IPRs will automatically belong to Automattic; and

(b) to the extent that the Employment IPRs do not vest in Automattic automatically, You will assign such Employment IPRs on request of Automattic; and

13.4 At the request and cost of Automattic (whether during employment or after its termination) You will sign and execute all such documents and do all such acts as Automattic may reasonably require:

(a) to absolutely vest the full right, title and interest in any Employment IPRs to be assigned under Clause 13.3(b) or in Intellectual Property Rights that both Automattic and You have agreed from time to time to assign to Automattic (“Assigned IPRs”);

(b) to apply for and obtain in the sole name of Automattic alone (unless Automattic otherwise directs) patent, registered design, or other protection of any nature whatsoever in respect of such Employment IPRs or Assigned IPRs in any country throughout the world and, when so obtained or vested, to renew and maintain the same;

(c) to resist any objection or opposition to obtaining, and any petitions or applications for revocation of any of the Employment IPRs or Assigned IPRs;

(e) otherwise to give effect to the assignment and waivers and licences contemplated under this Clause 13.

13.5 Automattic will decide, in its sole discretion, when and whether to apply for patent, registered design or other protection in respect of an Employment IPR or Assigned IPR and reserves the right to work any of the Employment IPRs or Assigned IPRs as a secret process in which event You will observe the obligations relating to confidential information which are contained in Clause 12 of this Agreement.

13.6 You hereby irrevocably appoint Automattic to be Your attorney to execute and do any such instrument or thing and generally to use Your name for the purpose of giving Automattic or its nominee the benefit of this Clause 13. You acknowledge in favor of a third party that a certificate in writing signed by any Director that any instrument or act falls within the authority conferred by this Clause 13 will be conclusive evidence that such is the case.

14\. Termination  
  
14.1 Notwithstanding Clause 2 above, Automattic may terminate Your contract of employment without notice, or pay in lieu of notice, if You are at any time (including but not limited to):

(a) guilty of dishonesty, or other gross misconduct, or gross incompetence or wilful neglect of duty, or commit any other serious breach of this Agreement;

(b) act in any manner (whether in the course of performing duties or otherwise) which is likely to bring You, Automattic or any Associated Company into disrepute or prejudice the interests of Automattic or any Associated Company;

(c) guilty of continuing unsatisfactory conduct or performance of your duties, after having received a written warning from Automattic relating to the same; or

(d) convicted of an indictable offence.

Any delay by Automattic in exercising such right to termination will not constitute a waiver thereof.

You will, if so required by Automattic, confirm in writing Your compliance with the obligations under this Clause 14.2.

14.3 You agree that Automattic may at its absolute discretion:

(a) require You not to attend work and/or not to undertake all or any of Your duties hereunder during all or any part of any notice period (whether given by You or Automattic), PROVIDED ALWAYS that Automattic will continue to pay Your salary and contractual benefits; and/or

(b) terminate Your employment at any time by notifying You that it will make a payment of basic salary (only) in lieu of all or the remaining part of Your notice period (whether notice is given by Automattic or You). In such case, Your employment will terminate on the date that such notice is given or such later date as Automattic may state in that notice. The payment in lieu will be made within one (1) month of the date that notice is given, subject to such deductions as are required by law.

For the avoidance of doubt, such payment or payments will not include the value of any benefits, Automattic's compensation plans or any other bonus/incentive, commission, or holiday entitlement which would have accrued to You had You been employed until the expiry of Your notice entitlement under Clause 2 above.

14.4 Automattic will have the right to suspend You on full pay pending any investigation into any potential dishonesty, gross misconduct, or any other circumstances which may give rise to a right of Automattic to terminate pursuant to Clause 14.1 above.

14.5 The termination of Your employment will be without prejudice to any right Automattic may have in respect of any breach by You of any of the provisions of this Agreement which may have occurred prior to such termination.

14.6 In the event of termination of employment hereunder, however arising, You agree that You will not at any time after such termination represent yourself as still having any connection with Automattic or any Associated Company save as a former employee for the purpose only of communicating with prospective employers or complying with any applicable statutory requirements.

15.2 If You receive an offer to provide services to any third party during the employment or during the period of the restriction set out in Clause 15.1 above, You will immediately provide a copy of this Clause 15 to such third party.

21\. Warranty  
  
You represent and warrant that You are not prevented by any agreement, arrangement, contract, understanding, Court Order or otherwise, which in any way directly or indirectly restricts or prohibits You from fully performing any of the duties of Your employment, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
