5.2 You will have the opportunity to buy a special class of stock, called A12 shares, that only Automatticians can buy. They give Automatticians a chance to own a bit of Automattic, at a good price, which is typically less than what investors paid, and provide a stable buyer (Automattic). You are eligible to purchase up to USD 1,000,000 worth of A12 stock, per year. Details and additional terms of the A12 Plan can be found at: LINK, which are subject to change in the Company's sole discretion.

Automattic will be entitled at any time during Your employment, and in any event on termination, howsoever arising, to deduct from Your remuneration hereunder any monies due from You to Automattic. This includes, but is not limited to, any outstanding loans, advances, the cost of repairing any damage or loss to Automattic's property caused by You (and of recovering the same), and any other monies owed by You to Automattic.

9\. Sickness Benefits

9.1 If You are sick or otherwise incapacitated, You must comply with Automattic's rules, from time to time in force, regarding sickness notification and doctor's certificates, details of which can be obtained from the HR team. In particular, in all cases of absence You must notify Automattic on the first morning of Your absence, giving the reason for the absence and its anticipated duration. If You are sick or otherwise medically incapacitated for more than three consecutive days, then Automattic may ask for medical verification. Thereafter medical certificates should be submitted regularly to cover the full period of absence.

9.2 Automattic reserves the right to require You to undergo a medical examination by a doctor or consultant nominated by Automattic and at Automattic's cost, and to consent to such doctor or consultant to release such details of Your condition as Automattic reasonably considers relevant to Your employment.

9.3 If You comply with the provisions in Clause 9.1 and 9.2, You will be entitled to receive Company sick pay, in accordance with Automattic’s leave policy (here: LINK), as it may be in force from time to time.

9.4 Company sick pay will be inclusive of any Statutory Sick Pay (“SSP”) and other benefits which You are eligible to receive. It will be paid subject to deductions for tax and National Insurance and other applicable deductions.

9.5 After Company sick pay is exhausted, You will continue to receive SSP when You qualify for it under the prevailing legislation. Where Company sick pay and SSP are payable for the same day of sickness, You will receive the higher of the two sums. Further details of the SSP Scheme are available from the HR team.

9.6 If You are absent from work on grounds of sickness or other medical incapacity:

(a) You will continue to be covered by Automattic's applicable insurance schemes, if any; and

(b) Your entitlement to the payment of Automattic's pension contributions, and any other incentive or bonus scheme, and accrual of holiday above the statutory minimum will cease on the expiry of the relevant period of Automattic sick pay referred to in Clause 9.3 above.

9.7 Your entitlement to Company sick pay and SSP are subject to Automattic's right to terminate Your employment in accordance with Clauses 2 or 14 hereof and Automattic will not be liable to provide, or compensate for the loss of, such benefit(s).

9.8 If the illness, accident or other incapacity is or appears to be caused by actionable negligence of a third party whereby damages are or may be recoverable, You will immediately notify Automattic of any claim, compromise, settlement or judgement made or awarded in connection with it. You will also give to Automattic all particulars that it may reasonably require and will, if required by Automattic, refund all or such part of the sums paid to or for the benefit of You by way of salary, bonus or benefits during the relevant period as Automattic may reasonably determine. Any such amount to be refunded, however, will not exceed the amount of damages or compensation (and interest thereon) recovered by You, less any unrecovered costs borne by You in connection with the recovery of such damages or compensation, and will not exceed the total remuneration paid to You by way of salary, bonus and benefits in respect of the period of such illness, accident or other incapacity.

10\. Holidays

10.1 You will be entitled to receive normal remuneration for all Bank and Public holidays normally observed in England. In addition, Automattic operates an unlimited holiday policy. You may take holiday in accordance with the policy from time to time in force. In particular, You must comply with Automattic's rules regarding booking of holiday and logging of holiday days taken.

10.2 You are expected to take Your minimum holiday entitlement under the Working Time Regulations 1998 of 28 days a year (inclusive of Bank and Public holidays) in each calendar year.

11\. Pension and Other Benefits

11.1 You will be eligible to participate in Automattic’s pension plan (“Scheme”) subject to the terms and conditions of the Scheme from time to time in force. Details of the Scheme can be obtained from Lori McLeese, HR Lead. Automattic reserves the right to terminate or substitute another pension scheme for the Scheme. There is no contracting-out certificate in force in relation to the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme.

11.2 The Company operates a salary sacrifice scheme to assist with pension contributions. Under this scheme You agree to sacrifice part of Your salary in return for a contribution to the Scheme by the Company on Your behalf, equivalent in value to the amount of salary You have chosen to sacrifice. Under the salary sacrifice scheme, the amount deducted from Your salary will be in line with any amount that would otherwise have been deducted from You for personal contributions. The Company’s contribution to Your pension will, as a result of the salary sacrifice scheme, be exempt from tax deductions and national insurance contributions. By signing this contract of employment You agree to participate in the salary sacrifice scheme. If You do not wish to participate in the salary sacrifice scheme, You must contact HR with regards to obtaining an opt-out form. If You do nothing, You are automatically opted into the scheme from the date Your employment commences. A salary sacrifice for pension purposes will only apply whilst You are an active member of the Company’s pension scheme. Opting-out of the pension scheme for any period of time will not prevent You from availing of this salary sacrifice agreement again, should You obtain membership of any Company pension scheme in the future. Further information regarding the scheme benefits and rules can be obtained from HR.

11.3 You will be eligible to participate in the Automattic health insurance plan, medical cash plan, income protection, group life assurance, and travel insurance plans, subject to the terms and conditions of such scheme(s) from time to time in force. Details of such scheme(s) can be obtained from Lori McLeese, HR Lead. Automattic reserves the right to terminate or substitute other scheme(s) for such scheme(s), or amend the scale of benefits of such scheme(s) including the level of benefits. If any scheme provider (including but not limited to any insurance company) refuses for any reason (whether based on its own interpretation of the terms of the insurance policy or otherwise) to provide any benefits to You, Automattic will not be liable to provide, or compensate for the loss of, any such benefits.

11.4 Any actual or prospective loss of entitlement to long-term disability or private medical insurance benefits will not limit or prevent Automattic from exercising its right to terminate Your employment in accordance with Clauses 2 or 14 hereof or otherwise and Automattic will not be liable to provide, or compensate for the loss of, such benefit(s).

12\. Confidentiality

12.1 You will neither during Your employment (except in the proper performance of Your duties) nor at any time (without limit) after the termination thereof, howsoever arising, directly or indirectly:

(a) use for personal purposes or those of any other person, company, business entity or other organization whatsoever; or

(b) disclose to any person, company, business entity or other organization whatsoever; any trade secrets or confidential information relating or belonging to Automattic or its Associated Companies including but not limited to any such information relating to customers, customer lists or requirements, price lists or pricing structures, marketing and information, business plans or dealings, employees or officers, source codes, computer systems, software, financial information and plans, designs, formulae, product lines, prototypes, research activities, services, any document marked “Confidential”, or any information which You have been told is “Confidential” (or with a similar expression) or which You might reasonably expect Automattic would regard as “Confidential”, or which is treated as “Confidential” by legislation, or any information which has been given to Automattic or any Associated Company in confidence by customers, suppliers or other persons.

Dear Teddy Ticktock:

**THE WORKING TIME REGULATIONS 1998**

This letter is regarding the Working Time Regulations 1998 (“Regulations”). As You may know, the Regulations impose certain limits on the hours which employees may be required to work, and guarantee employees minimum daily and weekly rest periods.

One of the principal restrictions contained in the Regulations is that employees must not work more than an average of 48 hours per week over a 17 week period. This includes any overtime worked, irrespective of whether it is voluntary or compulsory.

Employees may choose to “opt-out” of the Regulations, and voluntarily agree to work, where necessary, more than 48 hours per week. I am therefore writing to request whether You would be prepared to agree to opt-out of the 48-hour limit. If You agree to opt-out this will not mean that the Company will necessarily require You to work in excess of the 48-hour limit. Your normal working hours will remain as set out in Your employment agreement, with additional hours as necessary for the performance of Your duties. The Company will, of course, continue to ensure that Your working hours are not excessive for health and safety reasons.

If You are happy to opt-out, please sign, date and return the attached Opt-Out Agreement. Your other entitlements under the Regulations will not be affected.

You will see from the attached that You are entitled to terminate the Opt-Out Agreement with three (3) months' notice in writing to the Company. If You do serve notice to “opt-in”, the 48-hour maximum limit will apply immediately following the end of that notice period.

I should emphasise that You are not obliged to opt-out of the 48-hour weekly working hours limit, and indeed, apart from our ensuring that Your weekly working hours are in compliance with the Regulations, no aspect of Your employment with the Company will be adversely affected in the event that You decide not to opt out.

If you have any questions about this letter or the attached Opt-Out Agreement, or should you be concerned about signing the Agreement, please speak to Paul Sieminski at pes@automattic.com.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your commitment to the Company. We look forward to working with you.

Yours sincerely,

**The Working Time Regulations 1998**

**Opt-Out Agreement**

In relation to my employment with Ministry of Automattic Limited (“Company”) I understand that the effect of the Working Time Regulations 1998 is to limit my average working time to a maximum of 48 hours, inclusive of overtime, over a seven (7) day period, averaged over 17 weeks, (“the maximum 48-hour limit”).

I understand that if I do not opt-out of the maximum 48-hour limit, I will not suffer any detriment, and I will not be treated any less favorably than any other employee. I also understand that the terms of my contract of employment, in particular my agreement to work hours in addition to my contractual hours where reasonably necessary, are not affected by my agreement to opt-out.

Given the above, I wish to opt-out of the maximum 48-hour limit so that it will not apply to me indefinitely.

Additionally, I agree that if I wish to revert to the maximum 48-hour limit, I will give the Company a minimum of three (3) months' prior written notice, so the Company may make the necessary business arrangements to meet operational/customer requirements.

Teddy Ticktock
