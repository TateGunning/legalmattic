Dear Sarah Sweettree,

We are delighted to extend an invitation for you to join Automattoque ULC (the “Company”) commencing on February 15th, 2024 as a Maple Syrup Maestro reporting to Paige Planner. You will help shape and drive the growth and culture of Automattic as a member of the team, and we look forward to working with you.

Agreement Summary

Job Title

Maple Syrup Maestro

Annual Compensation

CAD 100,000

###### <Legalese>

Employment Agreement
--------------------

Your rate of annual compensation will be $100,000, paid semi-monthly. All amounts paid will be in Canadian dollars, less all applicable tax withholdings and statutory and other deductions. Also, you will be eligible to receive employee benefits normally provided to regular full-time employees. Please note that the Company may modify job titles, salaries, and benefits from time to time as it deems necessary.

You will have the opportunity to buy a special class of stock, called A12 shares, that only Automatticians can buy. They give Automatticians a chance to own a bit of Automattic, at a good price, which is typically less than what investors paid, and provide a stable buyer (Automattic). You are eligible to purchase up to USD 1,000,000 worth of A12 stock, per year. Details and additional terms of the A12 Plan can be found at: LINK, which are subject to change in the Company's sole discretion.

1\. Employment Offer

This offer of employment will remain open until February 21st, 2024 unless earlier rescinded or modified. If you do decide to accept this offer of employment, please sign and date a copy of this letter, and return to me.

Employment with the Company is contingent upon: 1) your ability to provide the Company with proper documentation to establish your identity and eligibility for employment in Canada; and 2) satisfactory completion by the Company of background checks.

2\. Working Hours

You are employed on a full-time basis, and will set your normal working hours, which we expect will be approximately 40 hours per week. You acknowledge and agree that due to the nature of our business, you may be required to work reasonable additional hours as necessary to perform your duties. Subject to applicable law, your pay includes compensation for additional hours worked, and you will not be entitled to any additional pay for working these hours.

You may also be required to work over the weekend or on a bank or public holiday, as provided by the guidelines on Working on Weekends and Holidays (LINK), and you agree that you will make yourself available to work these hours. You acknowledge and agree that this clause constitutes agreement to work such hours, if such agreement is required by any applicable legislation. You will not receive any additional remuneration for any weekend or holiday work.

3\. Privacy

You understand and consent that the Company and their affiliates may collect, use, store or disclose personal information about you or any of your dependents or beneficiaries (“Employee Personal Information”) as required for, or beneficial to, the conduct of the employment relationship (including benefits administration). You also understand that the Company may disclose your Employee Personal Information to a third party administrator for the purpose of administering your employment relationship with the Company or to service providers (such as legal, finance and accounting, information technology and human resources advisors and/or similar consultants and advisors), law enforcement or government authorities as necessary to comply with legal requirements or in the course of a legal action, and to legitimate recipients of communications under applicable laws, where required by law or necessary for, or in connection with, any legal proceedings and you hereby consent to such disclosure.

4\. Termination

It is expressly understood that this section will apply throughout your employment with the Company, even if your position, duties and responsibilities or compensation change significantly while you are with us.

Please note that, in all cases, except as provided herein, your rights and entitlements under any bonus or other compensation program (including any equity entitlements) shall terminate effective your last day of active employment with the Company. Further, you will not be entitled to any prorated payments under any such program for that part of the year in which you were actively at work. In the event of any inconsistency between this provision and the language of the applicable bonus or other compensation program, this provision will prevail.

a) **Voluntary Termination.** You may terminate your employment at any time by giving the Company two (2) weeks’ prior written notice; however, it is understood and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to waive all or part of that notice and accept your resignation at an earlier effective date. If we do so, you will be paid only to the date upon which we waive your notice.

b) **Termination for Cause.** The Company may terminate your employment for cause, at any time, without notice, pay in lieu of notice, severance pay or benefit continuation. Cause for this purpose includes such things as dishonesty, serious misconduct or a false statement, as well as any other conduct which would constitute cause at law. The failure by the Company to rely on this provision in any given instance or instances shall not constitute a precedent or be deemed a waiver.

c) **Without Cause Termination.** The Company may terminate your employment in its sole discretion for any reason, without cause, upon providing you with that minimum amount of advance notice (or pay in lieu) and that amount of severance pay, if any, to which you are entitled under the _Ontario Employment Standards Act, 2000_ (the “ESA”).

In addition, and upon your execution of a full and final release and waiver in favour of the Company, the Company will provide you with either:

i. one additional week of advance notice (or base salary in lieu) if you have less than five years service with the Company (which will include your period of service in any capacity with the Company's affiliates and/or predecessors); or

ii. two additional weeks of advance notice (or base salary in lieu) if you have five or more years of service with the Company (which will include your period of service in any capacity with the Company's affiliates and/or predecessors).

This termination provision includes any entitlement you may have to common law notice or pay in lieu and to pay in lieu of notice or severance pay under the ESA.

d) **Conditions Applicable to Termination Without Cause.** In addition, the following terms will apply to termination without cause, regardless of when it occurs:

1\. The decision to provide actual notice or pay in lieu, or any combination thereof, shall be in the sole discretion of the Company. The decision as to whether to provide pay in lieu of notice as a lump sum payment or otherwise is also in the sole discretion of the Company, save and except that any statutory pay in lieu of notice or severance pay to which you are entitled under the ESA will be paid to you as required by the ESA.

2\. The Company will continue your participation in the Benefit Plans for the minimum period of notice to which you are entitled under the ESA, subject to any limitations or exclusions set by our insurers.

e) **Company Property.** Upon the termination of your employment, regardless of the reason, you agree to promptly return to the Company all Company property of whatever type in your possession or under your control.

f) **Survival.** The rights and obligations in this Agreement which, by their nature survive the termination of your employment, shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement by either party.

5\. Confidentiality
